# AI-Language-Tutor
Capstone Project for Springboard's AI / ML online course

This is a suite of functions and prompts to construct a dataset, build a model, and run an AI language tutor using the Ollama library.

## WARNING: LLM's not included.

You need to download one yourself either directly from Ollama or from Huggingface via ollama API.  For instance, to use the Llama 3.1 LLM, I use: 

```
ollama run llama3.1
```
